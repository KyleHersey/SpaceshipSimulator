Ideas:
	Shiptypes:
		Capital support ship: 	Very very slow. Boost nearby smaller ships, does damage proportional to size of target ship.
		Bombers: 				Weak to interceptors. Heavy damage to large ships.
		Fighters:				Good against interceptors (rename grunt to this). Bad against bombers. OK to everything else.
		Interceptors:			Specializes in destroying bombers, weak against other things.
		Logistics:				Not fast. Heals nearby teammates. No weapons
		Dreadnaughts:			Lots of health, specialized in destroying other capital ships. Cannot hit non-capital ships.
		EWAR:					Apply lack of range, targetting capability. Energy? (add energy to ships?)
		More:   				-Essentially all of EVE online...-
	
	Ships need to be able to attempt to avoid collisions
	Determine fleet compositions before start (actual simulation)
	Fleet commander shiptype to give instructions to ships on its team regarding movement and targetting.
	
	FIND A WAY TO OPTIMIZE TARGET FINDING. ANALYZING ALL OTHER SHIPS IS N^N CALCULATIONS.
		Current optimizations: 
			Only target finds when current target is dead. Very limiting, very powerful(calculationwise).
			Collisions have inherently strong effect against larger ship count (given current movement patterns and area size).
	
	Adjust to at least take a large chunk of the screen.
	
	Can this be made into a game, where players determine fleet compositions?
		Ships have points. Allow up to a certain number of points per fleet.
		Players can specify:  	how many of each type of ship
								which targeting algorithm to use
								what flight pattern to use
